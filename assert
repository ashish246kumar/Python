assert is a statement used to test whether a condition is true. 
If the condition evaluates to True, the program continues executing as usual. However, if the condition evaluates to False, an AssertionError is raised, and the program stops execution.
def is_positive(number):
    assert number>0,"Number must be positive"
    print(f"The number {number} is positive")
    
is_positive(8)
is_positive(-1)
