difference between module and package?
                       Module                                                                         package
                 single file with  python code                                      directory with multiple module and __init__.py
File Extension   .py file                                                           directory contaning __init__.py
Usage            Group releated code                                                 Structured organization for large code base
Example          math_operations.py                                                  'mypackage/' with __init__.py, math_operations.py, string_operation.py
import example    import math_operations                                              from mypackage  import math_operations
initilazation     not required                                                       Requires __init__.py

python is interpreted language.That means python code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime . rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand like in compile language
**********
what are the benefit of using python lanuage as a tool in present scenario?
simplicity|portability|open source|strong community support|development speed|dynamic typing
